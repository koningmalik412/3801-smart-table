Description of the Project

The Smart Coffee Table aims to enhance social engagement between family members in a way which doesn't intrude upon peoples lives and ultimately allows family members to schedules events together. We have prioritised the idea of immersing both the physical and non-physical world together in order to enhance communication in the physical world and make scheduling easy in the non-physical realm. Our design will ensure that it is usable, accessible and easy to understand so all members of the family feel excited to use our Smart Coffee Table.


Features of the Project

The features of our project include

1. Homepage - Created to be the center of our Smart Coffee Table, it will provide a brief overview and ensure that navigation to other features is easy to understand. It will emphasise user control, ease of navigation and efficiency.
2. Calendar - This feature will be the most crucial feature of our Smart Coffee Table with the purpose of it to bring the family together and add events to a calendar. This will facilitate both the objective of organising family schedules and harness communication between the family members.
3. Event Board - The event board feature is a page used to highlight important dates in a discussion based format in order to ensure family members stay up to date without having to enter the calendar schedule constantly. This will foster engagement between the family members and create a sense of ownership over important dates they choose to highlight.
4. Games - The games feature will provide 2 pre built games with a touch to play mechanism with setting up the board and allows the family to bring their own pieces. This was intentionally done to ensure that family members aren't constantly touching and communicating through technology. It will also allow the family membets to take ownership with their own physical pieces and allows engagement without the need to touch a screen.
